    With a strong passion for java and reusable clean code I use design pattern and generics in implementing
    generalized solutions.
    I believe that "change is everything" and when we apply this truth to a developing project we get a
    different vision, at least about our code.
    <br><br>
    Over the years I have specialized myself in developing service libraries using Java generics, annotations and ORM.

<h2 class="justified">Functional Annotations</h2>
<p class="justified"> What would you say the following code snippet does ?</p>
<img src="assets/intrigue.jpg" class="foto" width="800" height="auto" alt="Photo">
<p class="justified"> Well,
    if you guessed that it creates a file,
    then opens a IOStream on it,
    reads it as a Zip archive,
    seeks and streams the File Entry named "data.csv",
    identifies the used encoding and opens a Reader on it,
    reads the content line by line,
    reads each line in a String Array and finally parses the csv content in a Stream of Java Beans,
    than you are probably right.
    And to be accurate it also does the complete reverse process when saving is called.</p>

<h2 class="justified">Generic REST JPA</h2>
<p class="justified">

    How about a Library, that used on a JPA Entity, generates a complete REST solution using CRUD and writes the unit
    tests for you ? <br><br>
    <a href="https://github.com/agache41/generic-rest-jpa">Generic REST JPA</a> is a JEE library targeted on creating
    generic Resource Services and Data Access Layers on top of
    JPA and CDI.<br><br>
    It develops REST Services starting from the CRUD pattern and extends it by adding frequently needed methods to each
    domain entity.<br><br>
    The idea behind it is that just by adding these generic services on each entity of your database you get a general
    70 - 90% implementation of the services needed by the application, thus allowing the developer to focus just on the
    complex cases, in other words removing as much as "boilerplate code" as possible.
    <br><br>
    And that comes with already developed test units that bring 100% coverage to all provided service methods.

    JPA</a> repository on GitHub.</p>

<h2 class="justified">Annotator</h2>
<p class="justified">
    You have to implement a solution that uses many annotations, and you already had a lot of issues handling them ?
    <br><br>
    Annotator is a plain Java library targeted on delivering an uniform reflection and annotation API over multiple ORM
    use cases.
    <br><br>
    The API is defined in the main Interface Annotate. Given a specific scope that can be a
    class/instance/field/method/accessors, 14 methods are available.
    <br><br>
    Using the annotator class through this API multiple points of interest can be queried from the ORM perspective :
    classes, fields, methods, objects.
    <br>
    In other words, learn once - use everywhere.
