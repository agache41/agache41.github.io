<p class="justified"> Well,
    if you guessed that it creates a file,
    then opens a IOStream on it,
    reads it as a Zip archive,
    seeks and streams the File Entry named "data.csv",
    identifies the used encoding and opens a Reader on it,
    reads the content line by line,
    reads each line in a String Array and finally parses the csv content in a Stream of Java Beans,
    than you are probably right.
    And to be accurate it also does the complete reverse process when saving is called.</p>
